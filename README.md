# PdfInvoiceFilter
An invoice filter made for an accountant working in a big company.
This little Python software is custom-made for a company's invoice.  

# Problematic
The accountant receives a lot of invoices each month. The received invoices are called randomly
and the accountant has to open each one, rename it, and filter it.  

The accountant is losing plenty of time by doing this manually.  

# Solution
PdfInvoiceFilter has a really simple interface where the user just have to browse the directory where all the PDF invoices are
and click "Filter".  

It will filter all invoices by creating a directory for the invoice company-related and placing it in the right directory.  
If the related directory is already created it will just place it in.
